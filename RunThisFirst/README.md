# Quick Test - Christopher
This is tested and works. If you can get this running, then you'll be on the right path to getting the rest working.

## details
What you need to do is add the JAR file to the projects classpath. That will be different for every IDE, you'll have to google how, sorry.

### Extra detail
You'll need to change the global variables to match your PostgreSQL's password and port.
